   * automatic anymore. As a workaround, we're removing the automatically set value
   * on mount in that case with this setTimeout, so it stays automatic. It's really
   * hacky and there're edge cases, but that's the best we can do right now.
   *
   * Also it doesn't update if the system color mode changes while the page is open:
   * it would if we'd set useSystemColorMode to true in the theme config, but it'd
   * also if the user has choosen a mode manually, so it's better to keep that false
